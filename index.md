<!-- # Differences from Past SRWs -->
Similar to past SRWs, NAACL 2024 SRW has two submission options--archival (appear in proceedings) and non-archival (only for presentation).
Authors can elect for both research papers and thesis proposals to be non-archival, in order to more explicitly encourage work in progress which can later be submitted to a future (archival) conference.
From a mentorship and reviewing standpoint, archival and nonarchival submissions are treated the same.
See the call for papers for more details.

# Anti-Harassment Policy
The NAACL Student Research Workshop 2024 adheres to the [ACL anti-harassment policy](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Anti-Harassment_Policy). Please contact any current member of the [ACL Executive Committee](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/about) or [Priscilla Rasmussen](mailto:acl@aclweb.org) if you face any harassment or hostile behavior.
